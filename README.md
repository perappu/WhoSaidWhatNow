# Who Said What Now

Dalamud plugin for tracking chat logs on a per-character basis. Good for crowded events and locations!

Takes ideas and some code from [Snooper](https://github.com/Maia-Everett/dalamud-snooper), and therefore is under the same license. Thank you!

## Current Features

* Only saves chat logs for specified characters
* Tracking can be turned on/off within the plugin to potentially save memory
* Stores all chat logs as tabs on a single collapsible window
* ðŸ“®

 ## Future
 
 * Track multiple characters in one group
 * Automatically whitelist names to always be tracked
 * Read backlog???
