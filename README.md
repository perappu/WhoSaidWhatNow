# Who Said What Now

Dalamud plugin for tracking/filtering chat logs on a per-character basis. Good for crowded events and locations!

Takes ideas and logic from [Snooper](https://github.com/Maia-Everett/dalamud-snooper), and therefore is under the same license. Thank you!

**We are now Dalamud official!** Find us by enabling test builds in Dalamud Settings -> Experimental -> Get plugin testing builds.

* Button to "Add All in Range", tracking all players visible to the plugin
* Filter logs by specific chat channels (i.e. /say, /em, /cwls2, etc)
